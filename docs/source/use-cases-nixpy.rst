=====
NIX can be used as storage backend for `neo <http://neuralensemble.org/neo>`__
a python project which aims to represent electrophysiology data whith python.
Furthermore NIX can be used through the Neo interface as a backend for the 
`SpikeInterface <https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ package. SpikeInterface aims to unify spike sorting in extracellular recordings.

Here we provide a small examples of how to structure your NIX files for reading NIX files with these projects.
